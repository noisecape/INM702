# INM702
This repository contains the solution for Task 1 of INM702, MSc in Artificial Intelligence at City, University of London. Our team of work is composed by Vittoria Castelnuovo and Tommaso Capecchi.

## How this project is structured
To visualize the work, it is required to use Jupiter notebook. In fact, the notebooks will contain the entire flow to the solution of the various tasks. In alternative to Jupiter Notebook, an general IDE can be used to open the .py files.

### Notebooks Folder
This folder contains two relevant files: Task1.ipynb and Task2_3.ipynb, which are the jupiter notebooks respectively for the first (individual task), the second and the third task.
These former file contains the solution to the first Task, while the latter for task 2 and 3. Both files can be executed entirely from Jupiter Notebook, without using external tools.

### Game Folder
The first task is contained in this folder. Inside there are 4 classes, Agent.py, GameManager.py, Node.py and Utilities.py.

### Task_2 Folder
This folder contains just one class, Neural_Network.py, which is the class that implements the entire solution to task2. Additional folder 'processed' and 'raw' are relatives to the data downloaded from the pytorch class MNIST. They store relevant information for the dataset. They are not relevant for the scope of this assignment.

### Task_3 Folder
This folder contains just one class, Neural_Network_Pytorch.py, which is the class that implements the entire solution to task3. Additional folder 'processed' and 'raw' are relatives to the data downloaded from the pytorch class MNIST. They store relevant information for the dataset. They are not relevant for the scope of this assignment.
